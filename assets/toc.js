   The "Bring a Barrier, Leave With a Build" workshop site (HKIS Teachers
   Teach Teachers, 2 October 2026). Built on the HKIS Biology reader
   template: course.js reads everything it generates from this file.

   chapter fields (see the Biology template's toc.js for the full list)
     id        unique slug, also used as body[data-chapter]
     file      path relative to the site root
     unit      id of an entry in COURSE.units
     title     page title ("1 Flint K12": the number goes in the sidebar gutter)
     summary   one line for search
     keywords  extra search terms not in the visible text
     time      working time, shown as a pill
     sections  number of [data-track] sections in the file, so progress can
               be counted without opening the page. Keep it in step.
     question  the one question the page answers (the progression strip)
     status    'ready', or 'planned' for a page that is not open yet: the sidebar
               shows it as Soon, links to it on other pages switch off (workshop.js),
               and its sections don't count toward progress

   unit fields
     sequence  false when the unit's pages are a list, not a sequence (the tools, in
               alphabetical order): the progression strip then marks only the page you
               are on, instead of what is done and what is ahead
     strip     the words after the unit's name in the progression strip's heading
               (default: "how the ideas build")
