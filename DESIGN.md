# Bring a Barrier Workshop Site: Design

This site is a copy of the HKIS Course Reader template (the Biology reader, github.com/dbbudd/biology).
Everything below is the template's design, kept so the two sites stay in step, with the workshop's
changes marked. In short:

- **Tools:** no Cards, Present or Printout. The red tool slot holds **Handout**, which downloads the
  A3 handout PDF.
- **Pages:** ten pages in three groups (The session; Getting started with the tools; App publishing), and no
  reference pages. Glossary pop-ups still work from `COURSE.glossary` in `toc.js`.
- **Storage:** settings and progress are kept under `vibe_` keys, separate from the Biology reader,
  which shares the `dbbudd.github.io` origin.
- **Listen:** the natural voices load from the Biology reader (`COURSE.voiceRoot`) on GitHub Pages;
  anywhere else, Listen uses the device's voices.
- **Spelling:** British, matching the presenter's copy on the session boards.
- **Contrast:** the template's small yellow labels (a video's date, the Example callout's label)
  are dark gold `#7a6000` on the light and sepia themes, which passes WCAG AA; brand yellow on a
  pale page is about 1.5:1. The dark theme keeps the template's colour.
- **Workshop components** are in `assets/workshop.css` and `workshop.js`, described under
  [Workshop components](#workshop-components).


This file describes how the HKIS Biology reader looks and how it is built for every learner, so
the same template can be used for another course. It follows the
[DESIGN.md format](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md): exact values are in the tokens
above; the reasons are below.

Writing rules for the words on the page are in `Writing Style.md`. Build steps for a unit are in
`UNIT-BUILD-PROCESS.md`. This file covers the design: color, type, layout, components, and the
Universal Design for Learning (UDL) features that the template provides on every page.

## Overview

The reader is a quiet, printed-textbook design with a small set of strong school colors. The HKIS
navy (`primary`) frames the page in the toolbar and table headers. The HKIS red (`accent`) marks
the few things a student should notice first: the chapter eyebrow, the "Key idea" callout and the
unit tools. Everything else is white space, dark text and one readable column.

Three ideas drive every design decision:

- **One column of reading.** A student reads one thing at a time. The column never exceeds 820 px,
  about 75 characters of body text.
- **Every tool is on every page.** Text size, theme, font, Focus, Listen, Translate, Search and
  Handout sit in the same toolbar on every page. A reader learns them once.
- **Color carries meaning, never decoration.** Each unit has one hue, used for its chapters,
  pills, cards and progress. Each callout type has one color and one label, so a student can
  recognize a misconception box before reading it.

The site is static HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript. It needs no account, no build step and no
server beyond file hosting (GitHub Pages). Everything a student sets or completes is stored in
their own browser.

## Universal Design for Learning

The template follows the CAST UDL Guidelines 3.0: multiple means of **engagement** (why students
learn), **representation** (what they learn) and **action and expression** (how they show it).
Each feature below is built into the template, so a new course gets it by using the template, not
by adding it chapter by chapter.

### Representation: perceiving and understanding the content

**Perception (Guideline 1)**

| Feature | What the student can do | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Text size | Change body text from 75% to 150%, in 10% steps | Toolbar, Aa panel; `--font-scale` |
| Three themes | Light, sepia (lower glare) and dark. Dark is chosen automatically when the device prefers it | Aa panel; `[data-theme]` |
| Font choice | Sans-serif, serif, or OpenDyslexic, a dyslexia-friendly font bundled with the site | Aa panel; `--body-font` |
| Focus mode | Hide the sidebar and center the reading column | Toolbar, Focus |
| Listen | Hear the page read aloud with the current sentence highlighted. Click any sentence to start there; arrow keys step; Esc stops. Speed control. Natural US or British neural voices run in the browser with no account, and device voices are the fallback | Toolbar, Listen; `listen-voice.js` |
| Described figures | Every image has alt text. Every SVG diagram has a `<title>` and `<desc>` that states what it shows | Chapter HTML |
| Captions that teach | Each caption states what to notice, not only what the figure is | Chapter HTML |
| Full-screen figures and interactives | Open any figure or interactive full screen, with arrow keys to move between figures | Lightbox; sim header |
| Reduced motion | Animations stop or shorten when the device asks for reduced motion | `prefers-reduced-motion` |
| Print | Every page prints cleanly, with the toolbar and controls removed | `@media print` |

**Language and symbols (Guideline 2)**

| Feature | What the student can do | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Glossary pop-ups | Hover or tap any marked term to see its definition in place | `<span class="term">`; `COURSE.glossary` |
| Word map | Search for any term and see the words it is built on and the words it leads to | `reference/glossary.html` |
| Translate | Translate the page into 14 languages on the device, with no server. Glossary terms stay in English beside the translation, so the vocabulary is still learned. Slides and flash cards translate too | Toolbar, Translate; `translate-core.js` |
| Plain English | Every sentence follows `Writing Style.md`: short sentences, no idioms, no personification, American spelling | `Writing Style.md` |
| Standard notation | Formulas, units, gene symbols and species names follow one set of conventions | `Writing Style.md`, section 3 |

**Building knowledge (Guideline 3)**

| Feature | What the student can do | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Anchoring phenomenon | Each unit opens with one real case that the whole unit explains | Unit overview |
| How the ideas build | See each chapter's question in order, with links, at the top of every chapter and overview | `data-progression` |
| Looking back and Where this goes next | Each chapter states the earlier fact it needs, and the next idea it leads to | `callout-recall`, `callout-ahead` |
| Key idea and Common misconception | The one rule to remember, and the wrong idea stated and corrected | `callout-key`, `callout-misconception` |
| Predict before reveal | Every interactive asks for a prediction before it shows a result | `sims/` |
| Course map | See the whole course as units sized by study time, with what must come first | `index.html`; `contents.js` |

### Action and expression: working with the content and showing understanding

**Interaction (Guideline 4)**

| Feature | What the student can do | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Keyboard use | Search with Ctrl/Cmd K; Esc closes panels; arrow keys move through figures and Listen | `course.js` |
| Visible focus | Every button and link shows a clear outline when reached by keyboard | `:focus-visible` rules |
| Any device, no install | Works on a Chromebook, iPad or phone browser, with a single-column phone layout | Responsive CSS |
| Embed and share | Any interactive can be embedded on its own in another site, such as SharePoint | `embed.html`; sim Share |

**Expression and communication (Guideline 5)**

| Feature | What the student can do | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Interactives | Build and test models (NGSS practice 2), not only read about them | `sims/` |
| Check your understanding | Write an explanation, then compare with a short model answer | `details.check-q` |
| Handout | Download the two-page A3 handout to write on (workshop) | Toolbar, Handout |
| Copy a prompt | Copy any prompt on the page with one button, to paste into Flint or Gemini (workshop) | `.prompt-card`; `workshop.js` |

**Strategy development (Guideline 6)**

| Feature | What the student can do | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| Learning targets | Read each unit's "I can" statements as a checklist, each linked to the chapter that teaches it | Unit overview |
| Progress tracking | Mark sections complete and see progress for each unit in the toolbar | Complete buttons; toolbar bar |
| Reading position | See where they are in a long chapter | Status bar at the bottom |
| Time estimates | See how long each section takes | Time pills |
| Prerequisites | See what to read first, with a link to it | "First:" pills |
| Search | Find any chapter, section, term or question | Toolbar, Search |

### Engagement: interest, effort and confidence

| Guideline | How the template supports it |
|---|---|
| Welcoming interests and identities (7) | Real cases and places students recognize; a choice of how to study (read, listen, translate, cards, slides, paper); content in the student's first language beside English |
| Sustaining effort and persistence (8) | Short sections with time estimates; visible progress; instant feedback on every quick-check question; a second version of each question to try after reviewing |
| Emotional capacity (9) | Self-checks are private and never graded; wrong answers explain why and link to the section to review; misconceptions are presented as common, not as failures; "Try this" tasks say rough answers are fine |

### Access without barriers

- **No account and no tracking.** Settings and progress are stored in the student's own browser.
- **Nothing leaves the device.** Translation runs on the device. The natural voices download once
  from the site and then run offline.
- **Videos load only when clicked**, so opening a chapter makes no request to a video site.
- **The reader stands alone.** A student who missed every lesson can learn from it.

### Accessibility fixes and known gaps

Fixed on 24 September 2026:

- **Skip link.** "Skip to content" is the first element on every page. It is hidden until a
  keyboard user reaches it, and it moves focus to the reading column.
- **Callout label contrast.** Callout labels are small bold text, so they need 4.5 : 1. The border
  colors stay as they are (they are decoration); only the label text changed:

  | Label | Theme | Before | After |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Example | light | `#ffcd00`, 1.45 : 1 | `#8a6a00`, 4.90 : 1 |
  | Looking back | light | `#577899`, 4.24 : 1 | `#3f5f80`, 6.11 : 1 |
  | Example | sepia | `#b89a40`, 2.14 : 1 | `#6e5510`, 5.58 : 1 |
  | Looking back | sepia | `#577899`, 3.39 : 1 | `#3a5570`, 5.69 : 1 |
  | Note, Try this | sepia | `#6b7d5e`, 3.27 : 1 | `#485840`, 5.62 : 1 |

- **Dyslexia-friendly font.** OpenDyslexic (regular and bold, SIL Open Font License) is bundled
  in `vendor/fonts/opendyslexic/` with `@font-face` rules at the top of `course.css`. Before, the
  option fell back to Comic Sans on most devices. The files load only when a student chooses the
  font.

Still to fix:

- Natural voices are English only. Listen reads other languages with the device's own voices, and
  greys out when the device has none.

## Colors

The palette is the HKIS school palette, used sparingly.

- **HKIS Navy (`primary`, #002a42):** the toolbar, table headers, glossary pop-ups and Heading 3.
  White on navy is 14.9 : 1.
- **Reading Blue (`secondary`, #14509e):** links, focus outlines, "Note" and "Try this" labels.
  7.9 : 1 on white.
- **HKIS Red (`accent`, #aa272f):** the chapter eyebrow, the "Key idea" and "Common misconception"
  labels, the section-type tag, the reading-progress bar, and the unit tool buttons (Cards,
  Printout, Present). Use it for no more than three things on one screen. 6.9 : 1 on white.
- **HKIS Gold (`highlight`, #ffcd00):** a highlight only, never text on a light background. It is
  the chapter eyebrow color in the dark theme.
- **Slate Teal (`teal`, #577899):** "Looking back" callouts and definition underlines.
- **Neutrals:** white page, `surface` #f8f8f8 for panels, `nav` #f0f0f0 for the sidebar, `text`
  #1a1a1a, `text-secondary` #555555, `border` #e0e0e0.
- **Callout tints:** `tint-key` #fdf0f0 (Key idea, Misconception), `tint-guidance` #eff6ff (Note,
  Try this, Looking back), `tint-example` #fefce8 (Example).

### Unit colors

Each unit has one hue, set once in `toc.js` (`COURSE.units[].hue`). The design system turns the hue
into a readable color for each theme, so a new unit needs one number, not a palette. The formula is
`hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)`, with saturation and lightness set per theme:

| Theme | Saturation | Lightness | Soft tint alpha | Line alpha |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Light | 45% | 34% | 0.13 | 0.35 |
| Sepia | 38% | 30% | 0.15 | 0.40 |
| Dark | 55% | 70% | 0.20 | 0.55 |

| Unit | Hue | Light | Sepia | Dark |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Biochemistry and Homeostasis | 210 | #30577e | #2f4d6a | #88b3dd |
| 2 Energy Flows and Matter Cycles | 30 | #7e5730 | #6a4d2f | #ddb388 |
| 3 Ecosystem Dynamics | 150 | #307e57 | #2f6a4d | #88ddb3 |
| 4 Reproduction | 330 | #7e3057 | #6a2f4d | #dd88b3 |
| 5 Genetics and Inheritance | 270 | #57307e | #4d2f6a | #b388dd |
| 6 Evolution | 90 | #577e30 | #4d6a2f | #b3dd88 |

Space the hues around the color wheel (60° apart for six units) so that neighboring units are
easy to tell apart.

### Themes

The tokens above are the light theme. Every color is a CSS custom property on `[data-theme]`, so
a component never names a color directly and all three themes work automatically.

| Token | Light | Sepia | Dark |
|---|---|---|---|
| background (`--bg`) | #ffffff | #f5edd6 | #121212 |
| surface (`--bg-surface`) | #f8f8f8 | #ede4cb | #1e1e1e |
| nav (`--bg-nav`) | #f0f0f0 | #e8dfca | #1a1a1a |
| text (`--text`) | #1a1a1a | #3e2f1c | #e0e0e0 |
| text-secondary | #555555 | #6b5b45 | #a0a0a0 |
| border | #e0e0e0 | #d4c6a8 | #333333 |
| toolbar and pop-ups | #002a42 | #3e2f1c | #0a1a28 (pop-ups #2a3a4a) |
| tint-key | #fdf0f0 | #f0ddc0 | rgba(170, 39, 47, 0.12) |
| tint-guidance | #eff6ff | #e8dcc0 | rgba(20, 80, 158, 0.12) |
| tint-example | #fefce8 | #f0e4c0 | rgba(255, 205, 0, 0.08) |

Sepia exists for students who find white glare tiring. Dark follows the device setting on first
visit; after that, the student's choice is remembered.

## Typography

One sans-serif family for everything: **Segoe UI**, falling back to the device's system font
(`system-ui`, `-apple-system`). It is already on every school device, so the site loads no font
files by default. Students can switch to a serif (Georgia) or to OpenDyslexic, which is bundled
and downloads only when chosen; headings follow the body choice.

- **Body 1rem, line height 1.7.** Generous spacing for long reading and for EAL readers.
- **Headings are bold with line height 1.3.** Heading 2 carries a 2px rule underneath it and starts
  a new section; Heading 3 is navy.
- **Lead paragraph 1.1rem in `text-secondary`**, directly under the chapter title.
- **Small capitals labels** (eyebrow, callout labels, chips) are uppercase, bold and letter-spaced.
  They name a thing; they never hold a sentence.
- **Every size scales with the student's text size**, because all sizes are in rem and the root is
  multiplied by `--font-scale`.

## Layout

### Page structure

Every page has the same four regions:

| Region | Size | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Toolbar | Fixed top, 48 px, navy | Menu (on phones), site title, progress, then the tools: Search, Aa, Translate, Listen, Focus, then Handout in red |
| Sidebar | Fixed left, 300 px, `nav` | Units and chapters, with the current chapter's sections underneath; Reference links (Glossary, Standards) at the bottom |
| Reading column | Up to 820 px, 3rem side padding | The chapter |
| Status bar | Fixed bottom, 32 px | The current section name and a reading-progress bar |

Below 900 px the sidebar becomes a slide-in menu. Below 760 px the toolbar labels hide and only
icons remain. Tables and wide diagrams scroll sideways inside their own box instead of widening
the page.

### Chapter structure

Every chapter follows the same order, so a student always knows where they are:

1. **Eyebrow** (unit name, in the unit color) and **title** (number and name, e.g. "1.1 The Cell
   Membrane").
2. **Lead paragraph**: one to three sentences on what the chapter explains.
3. **Meta bar**: study time and the chapter's NGSS standard chips, generated from `toc.js`.
4. **How the ideas build**: the unit's chapters and their questions.
5. **Looking back** callout and **objectives**.
6. **Sections**, each with a type tag (Core, Practice, Orientation), standard chips, a time pill, a
   Complete button and a copy-link button, all generated from attributes on the `<section>`.
7. **Check your understanding** and **Quick check** at the end.
8. **Previous and next chapter** links, generated automatically.

### Unit overview structure

The key sentence for the unit, the chapter strip, the anchoring phenomenon, the standards as
cards, the learning targets as a checklist, and a card for each chapter's interactive
(`overview.js`, `overview.css`).

### Spacing

A 1rem base unit. Paragraphs are 1rem apart, callouts and figures 1.25 to 1.75rem, sections 2.5rem
with a divider line. The section after the "How the ideas build" box has no divider, because the
box already closes the section.

## Elevation & Depth

The design is almost flat. Depth is used only where something sits above the page:

- **Pop-ups and panels** (glossary definitions, the Aa panel, search results, the Listen bar) have a
  soft shadow, about `0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)`, so they read as floating.
- **Cards** (word map definition, standards) use a light shadow or a 1px border, never both
  strongly.
- **Lightbox and full screen** darken the page behind them.

Nothing else has a shadow. Separation comes from white space, borders and tints.

## Shapes

- **3–4px** for callouts and small marks: nearly square, like a printed box.
- **6–8px** for buttons, chips, inputs and panels.
- **12px** for cards and the "How the ideas build" panel.
- **Full (pill)** for chapter pills, term chips in the word map, time pills and filter buttons.
- **Callouts have a 4px colored left border**; cards for a standard have a 4px left border in the
  unit color. The left border is the recurring shape that says "this box is a type of thing".

## Components

- **Toolbar buttons**: navy with white text; the Handout button is red so it stands out as "take
  this with you". Each has an icon and a text label; the label hides on phones.
- **Callouts**: seven types, each with a fixed label, tint and left-border color. The label is
  generated by CSS, so authors write `<div class="callout callout-try">` and never type the label.

  | Class | Label | Tint | Border and label |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `callout-key` | Key idea | tint-key | accent |
  | `callout-misconception` | Common misconception | tint-key | accent |
  | `callout-try` | Try this | tint-guidance | secondary |
  | `callout-note` | Note | tint-guidance | secondary |
  | `callout-recall` | Looking back | tint-guidance | teal border; label `label-recall` |
  | `callout-example` | Example | tint-example | highlight border; label `label-example` |
  | `callout-ahead` | Where this goes next | surface | text-secondary |

- **Section tags and standard chips**: small-capital labels above a section heading. The section
  type is red; the standard chip is blue-gray and links to its row on the Curriculum Standards page.
- **Pills**: rounded chips for study time, prerequisites and chapter numbers. A chapter pill is the
  bare number ("1.3") in the unit color; it is how any page refers to a chapter.
- **Figures**: a figure, then a caption starting "Figure 1.1 —" in bold. Photos, diagrams (inline
  SVG) and pairs share one style. Every figure opens full screen.
- **Interactives**: a bordered box with a header (title, "Interactive" tag, Share and Full screen
  buttons), the model, controls, and a readout that states what happened and why.
- **Quick check**: multiple choice that marks itself. Each wrong option explains why and links to
  the section to review; a second version of the question appears on return.
- **Check your understanding**: a question in a `<details>` element that opens to a short model
  answer.
- **Tables**: navy header row with white text, 1px borders, 0.9rem text.
- **Glossary term**: a light tint with a dashed teal underline; hover or tap shows the definition
  in a navy pop-up.
- **How the ideas build**: a 12px-rounded surface panel listing the unit's chapters and their
  questions, with the current chapter highlighted.
- **Unit overview cards**: standards cards, learning-target groups with a square-bullet checklist
  and chapter pills, and activity cards linked to each interactive.

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use the tokens and CSS custom properties, never a raw hex value in a component, so all
  three themes keep working.
- **Do** set a unit's color with one hue in `toc.js`, and let the system derive the rest.
- **Do** give every image alt text and every SVG a `<title>` and `<desc>`.
- **Do** keep one reading column, and put wide content (tables, large diagrams) in its own
  scrolling box.
- **Do** check every new text and background pair for 4.5 : 1 contrast (3 : 1 for large text) in
  all three themes.
- **Do** mark every technical term with `<span class="term">` and define it in `COURSE.glossary`.
- **Don't** use HKIS Gold as text on a light background.
- **Don't** use red for more than three things on one screen, or for anything that is not a key
  idea, a misconception, progress or a unit tool.
- **Don't** add a shadow to static content, or a second font family.
- **Don't** add a feature that needs an account, a server or tracking.
- **Don't** build a feature for one chapter. If it helps learners, build it into the template so
  every page gets it.

## Replicating this template

To start a new course from this site:

1. **Copy the shell**: `assets/course.css`, `assets/course.js`, `assets/toc.js`, the reference
   pages, `index.html`, `.claude/serve.mjs`, `.nojekyll`, and the unit tools you want
   (`flashcards.js`, `present*.js`, `printout.*`, `listen-voice*.js` with `vendor/piper`,
   `translate-core.js`, `glossary-map.*`, `overview.*`).
2. **Rewrite `toc.js`**: the course title, the units (label, short name, hue, prerequisites), the
   chapters (file, title, question, time, standards), the standards and the glossary. Every
   generated part of the site reads from this one file.
3. **Change the school palette** in `:root` and `[data-theme]` in `course.css` if the school is not
   HKIS. Keep the roles (primary, accent, secondary) and check contrast in all three themes.
4. **Write chapters from an existing chapter file**, keeping the structure in the Layout section.
5. **Copy `Writing Style.md`** and change its subject-specific rules and examples.
6. **Fix any gaps still listed** in the UDL section.
7. **Bump `ASSET_V`** in `course.js` and the `?v=` on every HTML file whenever shared CSS or
   JavaScript changes, so students' browsers load the new version.

## Workshop components

Added for this site in `assets/workshop.css` and `assets/workshop.js`. They use the template's custom
properties, so all three themes keep working.

| Component | What it is | Markup |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt card | A prompt to try, with a red left border, a small-capitals label and a Copy button. `data-copy` sets the exact text copied (the prompt spine copies with ___ for each blank); `data-keep-lines` keeps a long prompt's line breaks, for a tool that shows them (Shortcuts' Use Model). The Copy button sits top right; on a narrow card (under 30rem: a phone, or large text) it moves under the prompt, so the label and the prompt use the card's full width. A `<span class="token">` inside a prompt draws a variable as Shortcuts draws it. | `<div class="prompt-card" data-copy="…"><span class="prompt-label">…</span><p class="prompt-text">…</p></div>` |
| Prompt spine | The spine's blanks drawn as yellow lines (decoration, not text) | `<p class="prompt-text spine">… <span class="blank"></span> …</p>` |
| Marked screenshot | A screenshot with red numbered markers on the buttons to press. The markers are `aria-hidden`; the numbered steps beside the figure carry the same instructions as text, and the image has alt text. Give the image its `width` and `height`, so the markers sit right before it loads. A marker never grows past 6.5% of the picture's width, so markers on buttons that sit close together never cover each other on a phone. Add `portrait` for a tall screenshot (a phone, or a narrow window): it is shown at most 22rem wide. | `<figure class="shot marked"><div class="marked-wrap"><img … width="…" height="…"><span class="marker" style="left:…%;top:…%" aria-hidden="true">2</span></div>…</figure>` |
| Steps | A numbered list whose red circles match the markers. A list that continues the numbering sets `counter-reset`. | `<ol class="steps" style="counter-reset: step 2">` |
| Two columns | Two short boxes side by side ("Best for", "Start here"), stacked on phones | `<div class="two-col"><div><h4>…</h4><p>…</p></div>…</div>` |
| Video list | Videos two to a row, each with a one-line "why" under it. Videos still load only when pressed. |
| Placeholder | A screenshot or video still to come: a dashed, striped box that says what it will show, so it is never mistaken for the real thing. A fact still to check carries a yellow TBC tag. Search for `shot-todo` and `tbc` to find them all. | `<figure class="shot"><div class="shot-todo"><p class="todo-k">Screenshot to come</p><p class="todo-t">…</p></div>…</figure>`; `<span class="tbc">TBC</span>` | `<div class="video-list"><div class="video-item"><div class="video" data-video="…" …></div><p class="video-why">…</p></div></div>` |

## The session page (magazine)

`index.html` is laid out like a magazine, in `assets/magazine.css` and `assets/magazine.js`, scoped to `main.mag` so
the tool pages keep the reader's plain look. The film's boards are rebuilt in HTML and CSS rather than shown as
stills, with the presenter's board copy word for word. That keeps every word in reach of Listen, Translate, Search and
the text-size control.

**Type.** Playfair Display ("HKIS Display") for display type, numerals and pull quotes; Montserrat ("HKIS Label") for
small capitals, pills and buttons. Body text stays in the reader's chosen font. Choosing the dyslexia-friendly font
swaps both display faces for OpenDyslexic (magazine.js copies the choice to `<html data-font>`).

**Colour.** The HKIS palette: navy `#002a42`, red `#aa272f`, yellow `#ffcd00` and slate `#577899`, with light, sepia
and dark versions of each token (`--m-ink`, `--m-paper`, `--m-panel` and so on). Faded words, such as the unused
SCAMPER verbs, only appear in large type, where 3:1 is the contrast needed.

| Component | What it is |
|---|---|
| Cover | A card with the title on its two board lines, the red rule and date, the sign-in pills (links to each guide's log-in exercise), "You leave with" and an "Inside" list of the sections |
| Feature heading | The section's `h2` as a small red label with a rule running to the right |
| Step heading | The step's `h2` with a big red Playfair numeral hanging before it, a rule under the row, and the Complete button |
| Panel | A navy board with white type and yellow accents: the question, What it couldn't do, and the closing question |
| Board | A white card with a red top edge: Round 1 and 2, the barrier reframe, Build 01, Test 01, Build 02 |
| Ribbon tab | The HKIS ribbon's cut end as a bullet; numbered when the board numbers its steps |
| Help for this step | Buttons into the Flint or Gemini guide's exercises, and one into the tool itself |
| Loop ring | An SVG ring with HTML labels, sized to its own width; it draws once as it scrolls into view |
| Live fern | The film's four rules drawn on a canvas in the page's ink colour, redrawn when the theme changes |
| Tool switch | "Your session's tools" on the cover: two toggle buttons (aria-pressed) choosing Flint + Gemini or Shortcuts + Claude. Parts that name a tool carry `data-for`; the other pair's are hidden, and Listen and Translate skip them |
| Handout menu | With two handouts, the toolbar's Handout button opens a short menu (in the same pop-up family as Text and Progress): one row per pair, the reader's own marked, a missing handout shown as Soon |

**Ribbons.** Three HKIS ribbons, on the cover, the "If the machine recurses…" card and the closing card. Each one's
cut ends run off the edges of its card. On a narrow card a ribbon would run behind the words, so the card shows a red
edge instead.

**Text size.** The Aa control goes from 75% to 150%. The layout reflows instead of overlapping:

- grids use `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, Nrem), 1fr))`, so columns drop to one as the text grows;
- every section is a size container, and large type is capped at a share of its width (`cqi`), so a single long word
  still fits a phone at 150% in OpenDyslexic;
- the corners of the room, the split's labels and the loop's labels size to their own box.

Check the page at 150% on a phone, in OpenDyslexic, after any change to it.

**Motion.** Only the fern (it builds dot by dot) and the loop ring (it draws once) move, each one time, as it scrolls
into view. Readers who ask for reduced motion see both finished. Without JavaScript the page shows a picture of the
fern and a complete ring.
